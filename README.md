## Overview

* My portfolio is divided into 3 sections:

    * About Me
        
        * Short overview of who I am, and what I've achieved

    * Portfolio Content

        * Git Hub and LinkedIn buttons at top contain links to each         respective profile. My resume can be found on my LinkedIn page
        
        * Below those links are images/links to my assignments/projects     as well as the links to the GitHub repos for each assignment

    * Contact Info

        * Contains my phone number and email address for contact purposes

## Notes

* Working on this assignment, I realized that my skills are more in line    with creating functional code as opposed to creating an aesthetically     pleasing website.
